            That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,<br>
            But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
            His tender heir might bear his memory: <br>
            But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
            Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,<br>
            Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
            Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: <br>
            Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,

            A woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted <br>
            Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion; <br>
            A woman’s gentle heart, but not acquainted <br>
            With shifting change as is false women’s fashion; <br>
            An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling, <br>
            Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth; <br>
            A man in hue, all hues in his controlling, <br>
            Which steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth. <br>
