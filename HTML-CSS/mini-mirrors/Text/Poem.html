I<br>
think<br>
that I<br>
shall never see<br>
A poem lovely as a tree.<br>
<br>
A tree whose hungry mouth<br>
is pressed against the earthâ€™s sweet<br>
flowing breast, a tree that looks at God<br>
all day and lifts her leafy arms to pray;<br>
<br>
A tree that may in Summer wear a nest of robins<br>
in her hair; Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br>
Who intimately lives with rain.<br>
Poems<br>
are<br>
made<br>
by<br>
fools<br>
like<br>
me,<br>
But<br>
only<br>
God<br>
can<br>
make a tree.<br>
